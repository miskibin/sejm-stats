# Development Setup

The project is now split into two environments: one for the backend and one for the frontend.

## Backend Development

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
POSTGRES_DB=example
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
DATABASE_HOST=db
DEBUG=true
SECRET_KEY=does_not_matter
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=only_used_when_debug_is_false
BUILD_TARGET=prod
C_FORCE_ROOT=true
```

2. Use Visual Studio Code and open the project in a devcontainer.

3. Run the server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

4. To update data, run the Celery worker:
   ```
   celery -A core worker -l info
   ```

Note: The UI for the Django part is obsolete and will be removed soon.

## Frontend Development

> [!TIP]
> If you don't want to run the backend locally, you can use the production API at `https://sejm-stats.pl/api`. in `frontend/lib/api.tsx` file

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd ./frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
